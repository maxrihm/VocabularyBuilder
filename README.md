## Vocabulary Builder
Vocabulary Builder is a program designed to help you learn new words and reinforce the ones you already know. It works by parsing an Excel file of your favorite words from Google Translate and displaying them in a simple interface. The program also supports different translation services and provides two different modes for learning: flashcard mode and definition mode.

* **Flashcard Mode**\
In flashcard mode, Vocabulary Builder displays words on rectangles that can be hidden by clicking on them. This is a great way to test your memory and recall of the words you're trying to learn.

* **Definition Mode**\
In definition mode, you can click on buttons to open up the definition of the word on different translation services. This is a great way to expand your knowledge of a word beyond just its definition.
